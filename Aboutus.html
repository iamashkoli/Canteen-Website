    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
	<section >
		<p><b>A canteen is a store that sells food and drink at an institution <br>like a camp, college, or military base. 
            A canteen can also be a small <br>container used to carry water to drink.
            <br>College canteen is not just a place for students to grab a bite,
            but it's also <br>a place to hang out where they get all the entertainment to <br>beat their blues away and so it is a
            <br>popular hub on the campus both for physical <br>nourishment and for student bonding.
            <br>food, substance consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, fat,<br>
            <br>and other nutrients used in the body of an organism to <br>sustain growth and vital processes and to furnish energy.
           <br> The absorption and utilization of food by the body is<br> fundamental to nutrition and is facilitated by digestion.
